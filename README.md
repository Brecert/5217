# 5217

Inspired by https://web.5217.app and the [52/17 work cycle](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-rule-of-52-and-17-its-random-but-it-ups-your-productivity)

5217 uses three modified icons from [dashicons](https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons) which is licensed under GPL3.

## TODO

- make more expressive, and fun like 5217.app
- make some of the styling more consistent
- clean up css/js
